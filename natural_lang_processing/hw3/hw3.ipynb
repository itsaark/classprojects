    "1. Language identification\n",

    "In the first, you will train a classifier to distinguish between English and Spanish sentences, and will essentially be creating a working version of the classifier demonstrated at the end of the PyTorch walkthrough from week 3's lecture. In the second you will train a neural language model to generate new British place names. For the second part, you will find Chapter 17 of the Goldberg text to be a useful reference.\n",

    "**Note:** The networks that you will be training in this assignment are relatively simple, and the amounts of data are relatively small. That said, _**they will take time to train**_. On my laptop, the various networks take on the order of ≈5 minutes to train. Make sure not to wait until the last minute to do this assignment, as you will need to do a fair bit of experimentation and tinkering, and you won't want to find yourself running out of time."

One common (and well-performing) technique is to use trigram character frequencies, or other character-level features (writing system, etc.); some approaches rely on or incorporate word-level features. The difficulty of the task depends on a number of factors:\n",

    "The last point is a major one: many texts of interest (tweets, etc.) contain a mix of languages, which can cause trouble both at the time of _training_ a language identification system as well as at the time of _inference_ (i.e., when you're actually trying to _use_ your system). The problem can be compounded by mixed writing systems: due to limitations of text-entry systems, users of some non-Latin scripts often will often write e.g. Arabic using English orthography. Names of places, brands, individuals, etc. can also cause script-level code switching. Fortunately, for this assignment, you will not need to worry about this issue.\n",

Note that in the above equations, $\\mathbf{o}$ will have dimensionality of $(1, n-1, N_{classes})$- in other words, there will be one set of probability estimates for each time point that we have provided the LSTM. PyTorch's `nn.NLLLoss` class can accept input in this shape, and will automatically compute the average loss across the timepoints (and of course will do so a way that keeps the gradients around for correct backpropagation). Training this way can reduce the total number of computations that we need to do in order to train our model.\n",
