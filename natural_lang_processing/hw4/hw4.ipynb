    "# Homework 4: Sentence Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence segmentation is a crucial, yet under-appreciated, part of any text processing pipeline. In any real-world setting, text will not come to you pre-chunked into sentences, and if your pipeline involves any sentence-level analysis (parsing, translation, entity & co-reference extraction, etc.) the first thing you'll need to do will be split things up into sentences. This is a deceptively challenging problem, as punctuation can be used in multiple ways. Consider the following sentence (borrowed from Kyle Gorman's [excellent discussion of the subject](http://www.wellformedness.com/blog/simpler-sentence-boundary-detection/)): \n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Inc. said it expects its U.S. sales to remain steady at about 1,200 cars in 1990.\"_ \n",
    "\n",
    "This sentence features several periods, but only one of them (the last one) represents a valid sentence break. Sentences can also have embedded clauses or quotation marks, some of which may superficially look like a sentence boundary: \n",
    "\n",
    "> _He says the big questions–“Do you really need this much money to put up these investments? Have you told investors what is happening in your sector? What about your track record?–“aren’t asked of companies coming to market._\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to approach this particular problem; it can be approached using rules, which themselves may be encoded as regular expressions, or (more usefully) it can be modeled as a machine learning problem. Specifically, as a binary classification problem, where candidate sentence boundaries (i.e., punctuation marks from the closed class of English punctuation that can represent a sentence boundary) are either _positive_ examples (actual sentence boundaries) or _false_ (not sentence boundaries). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will develop and test your own sentence boundary detection algorithm. This assignment is shorter than our previous assignments, and is also much more open-ended. By this point in the class, you have been exposed to several different families of technique for text classification and analysis, and have hopefully begun to build up some intuitions. For this assignment, you can choose whatever methods you like: log-linear models, rule-based methods, some sort of neural network, it's up to you!"
